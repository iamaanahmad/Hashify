# **App Name**: Hashify

## Core Features:

- Text Input: Allow users to input text for hashing.
- Algorithm Selection: Provide selectable options for MD5, SHA256, and SHA512 hashing algorithms.
- Hash Generation: Generate the cryptographic hash based on the selected algorithm.
- Hash Display: Display the generated hash in a clear, readable format.
- Copy to Clipboard: Implement a function to copy the generated hash to the clipboard.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#1E3A8A) to evoke a sense of security and sophistication.
- Background color: Desaturated dark blue (#2A4365), creating a comfortable dark theme.
- Accent color: Silver (#C0C0C0) to highlight important elements and provide contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its clarity and legibility, making it well-suited for technical applications. Its neutral design won't distract the user, and it scales well across different screen sizes.
- Use minimalist icons in silver to represent the different hashing algorithms and copy function.
- Ensure a clean and organized layout for easy input and viewing of the hash values.
- Use subtle animations for feedback, such as a brief highlight when the hash is copied to the clipboard.
